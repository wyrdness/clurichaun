## Overview

The clurichaun is a fairy from Irish folklore, closely related to the leprechaun and sometimes considered its nighttime form. Small in stature and dressed in red or green, the clurichaun is **always drunk** and associated with wine cellars and drinking.

Unlike the industrious leprechaun cobbler, the clurichaun:
- **Haunts wine cellars** and drinks copious amounts of wine
- **Rides sheep and dogs** at night
- **Causes mischief** when drunk
- Has a **worse temper** than leprechauns

Clurichauns can attach themselves to households, **protecting the wine cellar** if treated well, but **spoiling wine** and causing chaos if angered. They are known for overturning furniture and general mayhem.

## Clurichaun vs. Leprechaun

### Are They the Same Fairy?

**Two Main Theories**:

#### Theory 1: Nighttime Form of Leprechaun
- Clurichaun is the leprechaun at night, after work
- Same fairy, different behavior
- Day: industrious cobbler (leprechaun)
- Night: drunk carouser (clurichaun)

#### Theory 2: Separate but Related Fairies
- Clurichaun is a cousin or relative species
- Different fairy with different role
- Similarities due to shared Irish fairy heritage

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Leprechaun | Clurichaun |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Occupation** | Cobbler (makes shoes) | No work, just drinks |
| **Activity time** | Day work | Night carousing |
| **Temperament** | Cunning, mischievous | Drunk, worse temper |
| **Primary activity** | Making shoes, guarding treasure | Drinking wine, riding animals |
| **Location** | Workshop, outdoors | Wine cellar |
| **Treasure** | Pot of gold | Wine stores |
| **Sobriety** | Sober (mostly) | Always drunk |

### Similarities

Both are:
- Small Irish fairies
- Solitary (not trooping fairies)
- Can attach to households
- Tricksters
- Similar size and general appearance
- Part of Irish fairy tradition
