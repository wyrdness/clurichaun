      "full": "The clurichaun is a fairy from Irish folklore, closely related to the leprechaun and sometimes considered its nighttime form. Small in stature and dressed in red or green, the clurichaun is always drunk and associated with wine cellars and drinking. Unlike the industrious leprechaun cobbler, the clurichaun haunts wine cellars, drinks copious amounts of wine, rides sheep and dogs at night, and causes mischief. Some traditions say the clurichaun is the same fairy as the leprechaun, but in drinking mode at night. Clurichauns can attach themselves to households, protecting the wine cellar if treated well, but spoiling wine and causing chaos if angered. They have a worse temper than leprechauns, especially when drunk, and are known for overturning furniture and general mayhem."
