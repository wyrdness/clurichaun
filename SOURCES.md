## Note on Sources

The clurichaun is less documented than the leprechaun in both historical and modern sources due to its lack of commercialization. Most information comes from:

- Traditional Irish folklore collections (19th century)
- Academic fairy folklore studies
- Comparative Irish fairy tradition research
- Regional oral traditions

Unlike the leprechaun, the clurichaun has **not** been extensively commercialized, meaning:
- Fewer modern reinterpretations
- More authentic folklore preservation
- Less academic attention (but what exists is scholarly)
- Better preservation of original tradition
